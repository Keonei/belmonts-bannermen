                <h3>Extra Life! Nov 2nd & 3rd on twitch.tv</h3>
                <div class="content">
                  <p><span class="strong">Greetings from grounds outside of Dracula’s castle!</span></p>
                  <p>The town is ravaged by demonic hordes, and Belmont’s Bannermen are here to save the day once more! Our siege begins on November 2nd at 11AM PST, and we need your help!</p>
                  <p>‘Tis the time of year where we gather at a humble house in the hamlet of Tacoma to raise funds needed to help out our kin at Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, who will in turn distribute your donations to our local Seattle
                    Children’s hospital to the North.</p>
                  <p>Put thee not in danger thyself, and instead view our struggles to gain the upper hand on a myriad of maladies by adjusting your screens to the address of https://www.twitch.tv/belmontsbannermen on the weekend of November 2nd and
                    3rd. From there, if you wish to aid us in our struggles, feel free to contribute to the fight at this address: https://www.extra-life.org/team/belmonts-bannermen. Indicate that you are there to donate, and would like to select a
                    team member! Choose then, from who you wish to escort your contribution to those who would give miracles to the young and enfeebled amongst us at the Seattle Children’s hospital.</p>
                  <p>If helping children, and watching our heroes suffer in their fight against the evil, let there be further perils you can hoist upon our heroes for thine amusement in additional ways. Yet, the mechanism for these additional perils
                    must be purchased in the form of donations as well, and should our coffers swell with these contributions, for the right amount, the following will happen to our intrepid adventurers:</p>
                  <p>Should you contribute $5, our heroes will receive a piece of armor from the hamlet’s armory. These are seldom helpful however, and will look… unconvincing to the children of the night.
                    For if $10 is found in our purse, you shall see the fickle hand of fate spin the wheel of pain which will randomly hamper our heroes in an assortment of ways.
                    For $15 a portion of a malicious intent will be thrust upon our adventurers. Early, it will be a bloody mary with the entire contents of an Arby’s meal blended in as well. Later, the selection will change, and so will the effects!
                    When $20 is received, we will rejoice with a brief respite and sing and play a song for our viewers’ amusement.</p>
                  <p>For the duration of our assault to fight back the night, we will provide cumulative goals to achieve and certain events will occur:</p>
                  <p><span class="strong">$100</span>&nbsp;If hit early, we will subject our intrepid party leader Paul to the trials of the Haunted Mansion!</p>
                  <p><span class="strong">$200</span>&nbsp;We will hunker down for a rest at a wicked public house and subject each other to a despised game of MYSTERY DRINK PONG. Gwen will be concocting some mystery drinks. A few good, a lot bad.
                    With
                    the throw of a ball, watch as they react to see if they were lucky or drinking some hot garbage!</p>
                  <p><span class="strong">$400</span>&nbsp;A party game fit for a king! Two of our party members are assigned a random snack from a disreputable source and are forced to work together to consume them. The person eating can’t use their
                    own arms! Hilarity will ensue.</p>
                  <p><span class="strong">$600</span>&nbsp;A treasure for all to enjoy will be revealed as the dark deed nears.</p>
                  <p>Pray thee wise and generous patrons, please help to get our voyagers push back the dark with thine kind contributions, and let the Seattle Children’s Hospital benefit from our generous boon. Please find us November 2nd and 3rd at
                    https://www.twitch.tv/belmontsbannermen and donate your currency at https://www.extra-life.org/team/belmonts-bannermen.</p>
                  <p>Thank you,</p>
